# CHIP-8
Essentially the "hello world" of emulation.

NOTE: This project was completed in C++, however the SDL library I used for drawing a screen for the emulator makes use of majorly C files. As a result this project will be highlighted on GitHub as a C based project majorly, however know that this has been 99% a C++ based project.

Below are the main references I used to complete the project. If you are interested in learning more about the CHIP-8, or you would like some guidance on how to get started making your own (and my excellent commenting didn't guide you well enough), these sites will be all you need for the most part.
