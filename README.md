# CHIP-8
### Overview:
Essentially the "hello world" of emulation and a project I did to learn more about bitwise operations, assembly, as well as hone some general C++ skills. Some of the code I used to complete this project is heavily inspired by Austin Morlan's tutorial on building the CHIP-8 (the specifics are outlined at the bottom of this file), so be sure to check it out, as well as his other projects on emulation, if you are interested in this area in general (link below).

Below are the other main references I used to complete the project. I would highly recommend checking these out as well for general learning, as well as completing the instructions, as they helped me out a lot and are in my opinion essential for learning about how each instruction functions in the CHIP-8, which you can then convert into your own code quite easily as the descriptions are highly detailed.
