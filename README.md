# CHIP-8
Essentially the "hello world" of emulation and a project I did to learn more about bitwise operations, assembly, and more. Some of the code is heavily inspired by Austin Morlan's tutorial on building the CHIP-8 (particularly a lot of the SDL section and some of the main loop), so be sure to check it out, as well as his other projects on emulation, if you are interested in this area in general (link below).

Below are the other main references I used to complete the project. I would highly recommend checking these out as well for general learning, as well as completing the instructions, as they helped me out a lot and are in my opinion essential for learning about how each instruction functions in the CHIP-8.
